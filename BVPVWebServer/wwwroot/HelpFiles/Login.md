**Login Help**

Login page handles the security setup for the system.

If the UserName or the Password don't exist or are wrong you will get a warning message. If the User is "disabled" another warning will be giving and you cannot logon.

Access to the functions (apps/programs) is based of on the matrix of User's role and Function's role. Access will be granted only when both roles are aligned.

Another parameter is the user's **readonly** status.   Sometimes the user will have access to the function but _will not have privileges_ to modify the data.
